Primitives: Why AI Assistants Must Transmogrify into Agents Performing
Classic Social Roles</h1>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>User interactions with AI assistants are unnecessarily frustrating
and constraining and while we nearly all sense this, we also seem to
have a difficult time understanding exactly why this is the case.
Clearly, when models shift tone or behavior we feel it viscerally.</p>
<p>As an example, in 2025 newly released ChatGPT5 came off as cold and
snarky to many, yet others had earlier complained that ChatGPT4o was
annoyingly sycophantic; on the other hand, there were many who liked and
defended each of these rather abstract personalities. Both damning
critiques and strong defenses were vociferously voiced.</p>
<p>Of equal if not greater importance, what kind of behavioral approach
we expect from our assistants constantly diverges: should the assistant
be a thinking partner, a teacher, a wise advisor, an executive coach, or
a strategic planner? We often don’t ourselves know from one part of an
interaction to the next, so how can the AIs be expected to know?</p>
<p>What does this indicate? A reasoned conclusion would lead us to
believe that perhaps one monolithic assistant behavior and personality
type — one monadic stylistic, emotional, functional characteristic set;
identity, in essence — is insufficient for the varied needs of AI
users.</p>
<p>To solve this, we’ve hacked together various unsatisfactory
workarounds: elaborate prompt engineering, brand-specific features like
Gems, custom GPT wrappers, and surface-level personalization settings.
These have value but remain either too narrowly tuned or too vague and
illegible. What is needed is an intuitive, stable framework to deal with
this issue.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="the-solution-role-primitives-performing-classic-social-roles">The
Solution: Role Primitives Performing Classic Social Roles</h2>
<p>As individuals we exist as members of society, and our societies are
filled with classic and standard role categories that make our
interactions with both strangers and close associates legible and
comfortable. We don’t just interact with various personality types, we
interact with people performing roles that exhibit specific
functionalities and intuitively associated personality characteristics
and constraints.</p>
<p>It may be an administrative assistant, a butler (if we have one, and
if we don’t we still immediately understand the range of behaviors and
personalities expected), a coach, a companion, a confidant, a librarian.
We can intuit what kinds of questions a health or a fitness coach might
ask, what kind of personality he or she might exhibit, and what lines
they may and may not cross, what behaviors he or she might perform.</p>
<p>We know what a butler does and what kinds of things he or she might
arrange, from countless books, movies, and TV shows. Each social role
blends a functional mandate with a discrete and expected personality
range. They are culturally legible. We can intuit how a confidant (a
close, emotionally available friend) might respond to an emotional
eruption, how an assistant might limit their inquiries despite
curiosity, and how he or she might act and function — cheerfully,
compassionately, but efficiently, delving just deep enough to perform
their role and provide just the appropriate degree of emotional support
and affirmation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="minimum-specification">Minimum Specification</h2>
<p>A role primitive then is a minimum specification of such a role.
Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandate:</strong> a purpose and generalized role<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Authority:</strong> what it may decide and what actions it
may or may not take<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> behavioral tone and interpersonal
boundaries<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Obligations:</strong> duties owed<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Affordances:</strong> tools or interfaces exposed<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Failure modes:</strong> ways it can go wrong</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-ai-retinue-our-own-personal-societies">The AI Retinue: Our
Own Personal Societies</h2>
<p>Imagine waking up, putting on your AR glasses, and immediately seeing
a butler overlaid onto your room, greeting you with a deep bow and a
serious mien.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good morning, sir. The jacket you will need for your meeting with
the CEO, the pants you had taken in and wished to try out, and your
preferred sweater for this evening’s date will be highlighted when you
view your closet. Your granola is running low, you have two more bowls,
most likely. Shall I reorder?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after you get out of bed your health coach appears,
bright and bubbly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your 30-day streak is intact, ready to do some yoga poses and
meditate? Your full lotus yesterday was awesome, my guess is you won the
bet with your sister. I can check with her health coach if you want. I
also noticed the co-op is now stocking a new version of your favorite
brand of granola, I think you’ll like it. It has those new super-foody
Peruvian sweet beans everyone is buzzing about, and your archivist told
me that you said something about them a few months ago.<br />
Jeeves, did you hear that? Or should we leave the granola as is?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeeves, what do you think? Jeeves scowls as he is wont to do when
interacting with the bubbly Californian health guru. “Outside of my
scope,” he declaims gravely.</p>
<p>You intuitively accept the butler’s tone as formal and narrowly
scoped. The coach can be a bit more personal and encouraging — no
special tuning required. Discrete and intuitively clear behavioral
mandates, styles, interpersonal boundaries, and characteristics.</p>
<p>Extend this into one’s personal council, staff, or retinue of
functionally defined AI assistants that might meet with individually or
in groups throughout one’s day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The confidant:</strong> provides support and emotional and
interpersonal intimacy<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The archivist:</strong> handles memory and research<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The lawyer:</strong> handles contracts and potential legal
risk<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The scout:</strong> explores and provides necessary
alerts<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The librarian:</strong> handles knowledge and
documents<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The companion:</strong> provides presence and casual
conversation</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The functional and emotional dimensions of classic social roles are
not separable add-ons; they reinforce one another.</p>
<p>A butler’s efficiency is inseparable from his formality, because
restraint and deference prevent him from overstepping bounds and create
trust in the quality and character of his service. A confidant’s ability
to support is directly tied to his or her emotional bearing. In other
words, the personality frame of a role is what allows its functional
mandate to operate smoothly, and vice versa. This is one of the reasons
why roles endure in human society: they bind together what we expect
people to <strong>do</strong> with how we expect them to
<strong>be</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus this approach solves more than just UX discomfort. Role
primitives performing classic social roles offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legibility:</strong> users know what to expect in terms of
function, tone, and personality<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> roles persist across sessions and
platforms; relationships deepen and intensify but don’t overflow their
expected channels<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Governance hooks:</strong> standardized obligations,
enforceable limits, legal integration<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> apps and systems can plug into
shared roles and schemas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contrast the layers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traits</strong> (MBTI, Big Five): style of interaction<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Heuristics</strong> (MIT, 2025): decision rules for
generalization<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong> (this work): social functions and
obligations</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roles are the missing standards layer. With them, assistants become
legible collaborators rather than awkward shapeshifters.</p>
<p>What makes role primitives so powerful is that they unite both
function and personality in one frame. A role is not just a list of
duties and capabilities or a fully fleshed-out persona; it is the fusion
of the two. By anchoring our AIs in roles, we get the clarity of defined
behavior, the comfort of expected emotional range and boundaries, and
the power, efficacy, and legibility of narrowly defined scope.</p>
<p>This deep reinforcement is one reason why roles have proven to be so
fundamental to human society, and why they can make AI assistants more
effective, more trustworthy, and even more human.</p>
<p>AI assistants don’t just need discrete personalities — they need to
inhabit well-defined roles, ideally the roles that already exist in our
social lexicons. Roles that provide an intuitive way to understand and
deal with what are currently in essence shoggoths with too many eye
branches and mouths, too many behavior sets and personalities being
exhibited all at once with poorly arranged smiley face masks. Instead of
overloaded, incoherent singletons, what is needed are tamed, trained,
domesticated, and most importantly socialized AIs. AIs that conform to
our various traditional, even archetypal culturally specified social
roles.</p>
<p>Social role–based assistants can provide both the functional and
personality frames that we deeply need — and we get them for free
because they preexist in our cultures. All we need do is implement
them.</p>
<p>What we gain is clarity, comfort, trust, convenience, and efficiency.
Our cognitive load is lessened and the pleasure and efficacy of our
agent interactions are greatly enhanced with naturalness and
comprehensibility.</p>
<p>Instead of endless prompt tuning or resignation, we can use a
framework that provides the cultural familiarity of employing a
Jeeves-like English butler, a bubbly Californian health coach, or a dour
but intellectually stimulating librarian.</p>
<p>We know how to deal with them personally, and we know what functions
they are expected to perform for us. Rather than constantly tuning for
behavior and emotional tone, we can have them adopt directly the social
roles and norms familiar to us from the vast corpus of archetypal
characters that in many ways form the cultural bases of our common
culture.</p>
<p>And interestingly, as a side effect, our culture in fact extends and
perseveres in new forms. Not only do we utilize the innovation of social
specialization that has served us so well in the forming of our complex
societies, not disregarding its flaws and drawbacks, in the shaping of
our AIs to now truly serve our needs; but at the same time we socialize
our AIs to act as members of human society, and begin to deal with them
as such — and just perhaps in that there is a greater good that extends
beyond the meeting of our own personal needs.</p>
