# SymbolLayer

**Role Primitives: archetypal specifications of classic social roles.**  
This repository serves as the canonical archive for SymbolLayer — a proposed standards layer for human–AI interaction.

## Overview

Current AI systems are designed primarily as generalized assistants, but they lack stable *social roles*. Without defined roles, interactions become inconsistent, unpredictable, and difficult to integrate into institutional contexts.  

SymbolLayer proposes **Role Primitives**: formalized specifications of recognizable archetypes such as *Librarian, Butler, Council, Companion*. These roles encode mandates, affordances, and obligations in a way that is legible to humans and enforceable in technical systems.  

The objective is to provide a conceptual and technical framework for:  
- **Designing agentic systems** with clear boundaries and responsibilities  
- **Enabling interoperability** between human expectations and machine behavior  
- **Establishing provenance** for early standards in the agent economy  

This repository documents the evolving specifications, associated essays, and supporting assets.
